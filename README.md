# Behavior Driven Development in Ada

This library provides initial support for behavior driven
development in Ada.

This is a workflow where you are invited to first write your
tests in English, then run them immediately, and start modifying
the code until the tests pass.

See the documentation at:

   http://briot.github.io/gnatbdd/

To get started and run a simple example, execute

   make test
